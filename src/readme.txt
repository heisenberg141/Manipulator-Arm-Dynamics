Final Exam Submission
This folder contains all the code for final exam for RBE501 Spring 22

The code is organised in the following manner:
1. ikin.m contains the code necessary to converge the inverse kinematics to the desired point.
2. question1.m contains the runner code to find the forward kinematics of the robot.
3. make_kinematics.m contains the code to generate forward kinematics for the robot
4. make_dynamics_model.m contains the code for generating G_List an M_List matrices for robot dynamics.
5. question4.m contains the code for forward dynamics and gravity compensation. It generates joint torques for holding the robot stable.
6. question5.m contains the code for inverse dynamics in newton euler representation. It generates the Torque plots for getting traversing the trajectory.
